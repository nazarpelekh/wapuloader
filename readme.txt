Wapuloader replaces Contact Form 7's Ajax-loader with a rolling Wapuu.

== Description ==

**Wapuloader for Contact Form 7** is a really simple WordPress plugin that does nothing practical apart from replacing Contact Form 7's Ajax loader (the spinning arrow icon that shows up when you press the submit button) with a rolling Wapuu image.

**Note:** Wapuloader works with [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/) 4.6 or higher. In addition, since it uses relatively modern techniques including SVG and CSS animation, the loader image won't be rendered correctly on legacy browsers. *Please do not expect any practical functionality from this plugin.*
